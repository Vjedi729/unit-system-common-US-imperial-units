# Common US Customary Units for the Unit System
A prebuild subset of the  [US Customary system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_customary_units) for use with my Unit System (at [Vjedi729/unit-system](https://github.com/Vjedi729/unit-system)). This should cover all units used by an average person in daily life.

This system relies on the SI Units (at [Vjedi729/unit-system-si-units](https://github.com/Vjedi729/unit-system-SI-units)) as an underlying basis.
